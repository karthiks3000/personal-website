    paragraph2: "Over the past decade, I've built scalable web applications and led engineering teams at companies like Scholastic and Viacom. What started as writing code in Mumbai has evolved into architecting cloud solutions and mentoring developers across different continents.",
    
    paragraph3: "When I'm not busy with work or playing with the kids, you'll find me savoring the perfect cup of coffee, diving into RPG adventures, or flying my drone around Waterloo. I believe the best code tells a story, and I love sharing those stories through technical writing and open source contributions."
